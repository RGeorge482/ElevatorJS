# ElevatorJS

In this project I implemented the way how two elevators will travel in a building of 10 stories tall. The building contains two elevators: elevator A goes to all floors except the last one, and elevator B goes all way up except the basement. The elevators can be called by clicking the buttons located next to the elevator shafts on their floor. The system sets the moving timer for both of the elevators. There is an emergency button inside each elevator. When that is pushed, the elevator goes to their nears floor and opens their doors.
